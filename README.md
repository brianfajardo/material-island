Using a test-driven development approach to deconstruct and recreate JavaScript higher-order functions. <br>
Created jsEasyTest.js which expands on jsTinyTest.js. Added features:
* color coded console log of test success or fail
* In the event of a failed test, error stacktrace is nested and collapsed in the test name
* DOM statistic summary

Base framework jsTinyTest: https://github.com/joewalnes/jstinytest

Todo:
* ~~.forEach~~
* ~~.filter~~
* ~~.map~~
* ~~.reduce~~
* ~~modify jsTinyTest to make it even simpler --> jsEasyTest.js~~
